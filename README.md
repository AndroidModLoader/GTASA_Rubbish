### What is this mod?

This is a rubbish system ported from GTA:VC reverse engineered version named reVC.
However, the main idea was started by [gennariarmando](https://github.com/gennariarmando/rubbish-sa) that made his version based on GTA 3 (re3) version.
It has a little idea of rubbish reacting to the shooting so.. i took it!
Also contains a bit of optimizations! :P
